          My dearest friend,
        </p>
          I still remember the exhilaration that coursed through my veins the first time we chatted. It was as if the stars had aligned to bring us together, two kindred spirits from opposite sides of the world. In this short amount of time, I feel as though I've known you for eternity. You've ignited a fire within me that has been smoldering for far too long.
        </p>
          For over 15 years, I've dreamed of visiting Korea, but it was only through your unwavering belief in me that I've come to truly believe that I can make it a reality. Your passion for life, your willingness to take risks and share your deepest emotions have inspired me beyond measure.
        </p>
          I believe with every fiber of my being that we've created a sisterhood bond that transcends time and distance. I feel so incredibly grateful to have you in my life. The thought of all the possibilities that lie ahead for us fills me with such hope and joy that I can barely contain my emotions.
        </p>
          서희야, I wish you a life filled with health, love, and endless possibilities. Keep pushing forward, shining brightly as only you can. Happy belated birthday, and know that I love you with all my heart.
        </p>
